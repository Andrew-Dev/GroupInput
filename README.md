# GroupInput
A polling app that lets you ask questions in real time to an audience.

This app was built for an independent study class I took at my high school. It has a Ruby on Rails based web server for the web side of things, a Socket/Node server for delivering live questions, and a mobile app built with the Ionic framework for clients to respond to questions.
